Object detection using Transfer Learning of CNN architectures
Load in a pre-trained CNN model trained on a large dataset
b. Freeze parameters (weights) in the modelâ€™s lower convolutional layers
c. Add a custom classifier with several layers of trainable parameters to model
d. Train classifier layers on training data available for the task
e. Fine-tune hyperparameters and unfreeze more layers as needed
